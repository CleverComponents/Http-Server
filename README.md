# Multithreaded HTTP Server in Delphi

<img align="left" src="https://www.clevercomponents.com/images/HttpServer-2-250.jpg" />

This project introduces a fully functional multithreaded HTTP server that works asynchronously in a thread pool, accepts the GET, POST, PUT, and other HTTP requests.

We have added the SSL / TLS support to the TclHttpServer component, implemented server-side certificate management, and updated the HttpServerDemo project. Now, this demo program allows you to run a simple static website and access it using a web browser via HTTP or HTTPS protocols.

The HTTP server component is built based on the [Clever Internet Suite](https://www.clevercomponents.com/products/inetsuite/) library and uses the fast and stable classes: TclTcpServer, TclUserConnection, and TclThreadPool.
